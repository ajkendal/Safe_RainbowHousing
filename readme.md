### Description

Our assigned topic was intergenerational LGBT collaboration and connection. There was a lot of information from SAGE in our packet that highlighted how we treat some of our most vulnerable community members, including our elders and our youth. Immediately, we thought about ways to create the opportunities for connections between these communities, and started brainstorming for solutions to problems that impact them most. In our research, we realized that there were not a ton of resources available, and a lot of them might be inaccessible. We want to create a true community online to connect our folks to each other and to support - that's where our app comes in. We'll have a searchable database of local shelters and LGBT-friendly housing options, and a chat function to help people find the resources that are closest and most helpful to them! <br />
